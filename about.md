I'm a Software Engineer working at m3ter with a knack for AWS and an ambition for building reliable software. I'm focused primarily on backend engineering with Java, CDK, DynamoDB and Lambda. This site will probably be mostly tech focused but may contain a bit of anything and everything too. 

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
